Congratulations! After a lot of hard work in the data munging mines, you've landed a job as Lead Analyst for an independent gaming company. You've been assigned the task of analyzing the data for their most recent fantasy game Heroes of Pymoli.
Like many others in its genre, the game is free-to-play, but players are encouraged to purchase optional items that enhance their playing experience. As a first task, the company would like you to generate a report that breaks down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights.
My final report includes insights from each of the following: player count, purchasing analysis, gender demographics, age demographics, top spenders, most popular items and most profitable items.

    
# Data Analysis

Three observable trends based on my Heroes of Pymoli data analysis:
  1. Pymoli players overwhelmingly identify as male. Therefore, they are more likely to buy more items and spend more money.
  2. Most players are teenagers or young adults.
  3. Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the two most popular and most profitable items.
