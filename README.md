My job as a data analyst was to analyze the ourchasing data for Heroes of Pymoli. Users can play the game for free, but are encouraged to 
purchase tools to make the game experience more fun. The gaming company wanted me to explore the data and pull a few trends that will influence
the company's decision making.

Three observable trends based on my Heroes of Pymoli data analysis:
  1. Pymoli players overwhelmingly identify as male. Therefore, they are more likely to buy more items and spend more money.
  2. Most players are teenagers or young adults.
  3. Final Critic and Oathbreaker, Last Hope of the Breaking Storm are the two most popular and most profitable items.
